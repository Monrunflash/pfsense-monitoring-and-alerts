This project is designed to enhance the monitoring and automation capabilities of a pfSense firewall. By using Docker containers, the project sets up a suite of services that can continuously monitor the performance and status of the firewall. In the event that any issues are detected, the project includes scripts that can automatically identify the problem and generate notifications to alert the appropriate parties. This ensures that any problems with the firewall are detected and resolved as quickly as possible, minimizing downtime and ensuring the smooth operation of the network.
